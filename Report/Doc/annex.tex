\section{Annex: LLM Usage in this Project}

\label{annex:llm}

For the preparation of this report, Large Language Models (LLMs) were used as support tools to enhance technical writing quality and structure. The following describes their specific application and the safeguards implemented to maintain academic integrity.

\subsection*{LLM Applications}

\begin{itemize}[label=---]

\item \textbf{Linguistic Correction and Refinement}: The AI assisted in improving the flow of technical English and corrected syntax or grammar errors to enhance readability for an academic audience.

\item \textbf{LaTeX Structure and Formatting}: The AI was used to troubleshoot LaTeX compilation errors, specifically regarding image placement, table formatting, and special character management (e.g., \texttt{\textbackslash textit}, \texttt{\textbackslash textbf}, \texttt{\textbackslash includegraphics}).

\item \textbf{Synthesis Assistance}: The AI helped structure explanations based on raw scan results (Nmap, Nessus, DSM configuration) to make technical findings clearer and more accessible to readers unfamiliar with security assessment tools.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Important Clarifications}

\begin{itemize}[label=---]

\item \textbf{Original Content}: All technical data (network scans, vulnerability findings, configuration screenshots, threat analysis) are the direct result of personal work conducted on the organization's network infrastructure. The STRIDE threat model, risk assessment, and security recommendations are entirely original analytical work.

\item \textbf{Verification}: Every suggestion or explanation provided by the AI was cross-validated against authoritative sources including official documentation (Synology DSM guides, Nmap manual, Nessus documentation), academic literature (STRIDE framework, Microsoft SDL), and security standards (NIST SP 800-115, CIS benchmarks) to prevent potential errors or ``hallucinations.''

\item \textbf{Confidentiality}: No sensitive data (IP addresses, MAC addresses, hostnames, credentials, organizational identifiers) was shared with the LLM. All project-specific information was anonymized before any AI interaction to prevent potential data leakage through model training vectors.

\item \textbf{Academic Integrity}: The LLM functioned strictly as an \textit{assistive editing tool}, not as a \textit{content generation tool}. All security findings, threat classifications, and mitigation strategies presented in this report are based on empirical evidence from network assessments and established cybersecurity frameworks, validated independently by the author.

\end{itemize}
